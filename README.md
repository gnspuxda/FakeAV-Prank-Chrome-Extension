# FakeAV-Prank-Chrome-Extension
This is a fake prank extension that supports all browsers called "Universal Browser Defender - Online Smart Antivirus" that poses as an antivirus which works on your web browser. The purpose of the prank extension is to trick victims into thinking their device is infected. My prank extension is programmed so that when a user opens up a popular website from a list of websites (some of the websites in the list are Google, YouTube, and Google Play), it displays a fake alert saying there are viruses on the device and they only way they could possibly be removed is through visiting a shortened TinyURL link. This link holds a familiar surprise (a Rickroll), but not everyone might expect it to pop up at that exact moment. In all, it's a good prank to pull on your friends. Especially on April 1st or maybe even National Computer Security Day!

Information about the code (what every file is):
content.js - the javascript code responsible for the fake prank alert
icon(number).png - the icons for the chrome extension
manifest.json - the chrome extension's manifest (manifest v3, and it's responsible for opening "content.js")
